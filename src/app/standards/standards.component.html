    <h3>Decision Making</h3>
      <ol *ngIf="expand('decision-making-rules')">
        <li>
          As human beings we are all individually responsible for our choices in life. We should therefore never seek to force any person to think or act against their conscience. Human beings are free to choose to accept obligations for themselves and to make agreements that bind them into obligations to one another.
        </li>
        <li>
          Muslims are required to make their decisions through reaching agreement by listening to one another and not by any other means. A decision imposed by force on one group by another is a crime. In particular:
          <ol>
            <li>
              It is a crime for any people to impose their opinions, ideas, religion, system of government, ideology etc on another against their will.
            </li>
            <li>
              An agreement made by one generation of people cannot bind the next generation of people. Each generation of people must reach their own agreements.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a majority of people clearly oppose any particular decision, then that decision cannot be considered agreed upon by those people and is therefore invalid.
            </li>
          </ol> 
          <li>
            Muslims are required to reach agreements on suitable standards for defining accepted and rejected behaviour. Such standards define what is refered to as "Islamic Law" or "shariah".
          </li>
          <li>
            Muslims are required to unify their efforts to make such good agreed standards known to all.  
          </li>
          <li>
            Muslims are required to treat other Muslims in particular with respect and not to insult one another.
          </li>
          <li>
            Muslims are required to avoid any bias or preferential treatment of people who are in a dispute.
          </li>
          <li>
            Muslims are forbidden to fight against or target in any hostile way those individuals who leave Muslims alone, never fighting them and only meeting them in peace.
          </li>
          <li>
            Muslims must never take any life except to protect life by stopping those who kill others wrongfully.
          </li>
          <li> 
            Muslims are required to build alliances with one another to defend each other's lives.
          </li>
          <li>
            Muslims must never fight unless it is necessary to defend their lives or essential freedom. In particular it is a crime to fight without having the leadership and organisation necessary to negotiate an end to the fighting.

    <h3>Contract Validity Rules</h3>
      <ol *ngIf="expand('contract-rules')">
        <li>
          For contracts between people to be enforcable, they must be a fair representation of the free choice of the people involved. The following are requirements for contracts to be valid:
          <ol>
            <li>
              The parties must be adult, mentally competent human beings or be recognised <span term="guardian">s</span> acting on behalf of others.
            </li>
            <li>
              There must be no threat forcing any party to agree to the contract.
            </li>
            <li>
              The parties must be free to choose other people to make any similar contract with instead.
            </li>
            <li>
              The terms of the contract must be clear and precise enough to avoid deception and as many  misunderstandings as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              If there are incremental or changing liabilities resulting from a contract, such as rent, usage or service charges or penalties, then those charges can only be incurred by positive action by the party incurring them and cannot be automatically incurred. In particular, it must be possible at any time for the party incurring such charges to stop incurring them by ceasing their use of the relevant service just by giving notice that the service is no longer needed and the party providing the service to stop doing so when that notice comes into effect. 
            </li>
            <li>
              The obligations incurred in any contract cannot override the obligations of another contract already in place with another party. Prior obligations always take priority.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any party claiming compensation for a breach of contractual obligations must prove in a dispute arbitration process that other party is at fault for causing actual damage.  
            </li>
            <li>
              A party failing to pay a debt due to lack of wealth will not be considered to be at fault. 
            </li>
            <li>
              A contract can be ended or amended by the same parties who agreed it.
            </li>
            <li>
              A contract can only put obligations on parties agreeing to the contract.
            </li>
            <li>
              The definition of terms used to form a contract should come from well known standard usage or be explicitly defined in the contract to avoid potential disputes. 
            </li>
            <li>
              For future obligations to be enforcable contracts must be recorded in writing with at least 2 witnesses. Witnesses should be able to verify the terms of the contract and that these contract validity rules have been followed.

    <h3>Prayer Times and Direction</h3>
    <ol *ngIf="expand('prayer-times-rules')">
      <li>
        Standard prayer times are based on open source calculation algorithms for astronomical measures. In particular the following rules are applied:
        <ol>
          <li>
            There are adjustments for extreme latitudes to ensure that there are reasonable minimum and maximum times between the prayers. 
            <ol>
              <li>
              The time from the fajr prayer until the isha prayer does not exceed 20 hours.
              </li>
              <li>
              The time from sunrise to maghrib prayer time is at least 4 hours and is no more than 18 hours. 
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Fajr and Isha prayer times without adjustments are based on the sun being 18 degrees below the horizon corresponding to astronomical dawn and astronomical night respectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            Times are rounded up to the nearest minute. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Asr times are based on two thirds of the way between zuhr and maghrib prayer times
          </li>
          <li>
            A new moon is considered visible if it is more than 1 day old

    <h3>Zakat Calculation</h3>
    <ol *ngIf="expand('zakat-rules')">
      <li>
         Zakat is a centrally collected charitable donation for wealth redistribution which all Muslims are religously obliged to pay if they are wealthy enough. The following rules should be used to calculate the amount of zakat owed:
        <ol>
          <li>
            A Muslim is judged to be wealthy enough if they have sufficient assets to pay for their needs and the needs of their dependents for the following year. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Any child declared as a dependent will be considered as such during the subsequent year between zakat dates for the purposes of inheritance rights calculations.
          </li>
          <li>
            The standard goods and services which may be purchased and everyone needs are:
            <ol>
              <li>Water and Sewage</li>
              <li>Food</li>
              <li>Clothing</li>
              <li>Shelter</li>
              <li>Fuel</li>
              <li>Communication</li>
              <li>Transportation</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            The costs of needs are determined by an annually adjusted standard estimate of the cost of the needed goods and services per person per year. This is called the "Zakat Free Wealth Allowance".  
          </li>
          <li>
            For the 1437-1438 Hijri year (2016-2017) the Zakat Free Wealth Allowance is set to $15,000.00 USD
          </li>
          <li>
            All values should be calculated for the date of the 15th Ramadan 12pm GMT based on the standard prayer times calendar for London UK. This time is called the Zakat Date.
          </li>
          <li>
            The calculated Zakat Free Wealth Allowance in other currencies is based on conversion rates on the Zakat Date.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each individual calculates a Net Zakatable Wealth calculation. This is an estimate of the net value of all assets minus all debts that the individual and any dependents have on the Zakat date and then deducting the individual's Zakat Free Wealth Allowance. Debts should be estimated based on their immediate settlement value / cost.
          </li>
          <li>
            The amount of Zakat that should be paid is 1/40<sup>th</sup> of an individual's Net Zakatable Wealth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Zakat can be paid over the following year between the Zakat Date of one year and the Zakat Date of the next year. This allows ample time to sell any necessary assets and allows spreading the payment in easy installments. 
          </li>
          <li>
            A dependent has the right to have their needs met by the person they depend upon. 
          </li>
          <li>
            A individual can only have one person on whom they are declared dependent and who can add their Zakat Free Wealth Allowance, Assets and Debts to their own for a Zakat calculation.

    <h3>Marriage Rules</h3>
    <ol *ngIf="expand('marriage-rules')">
      <li>
        Marriage is an agreement between a <span term="man"></span> and a <span term="woman"></span> that they will have sex.  
      </li>
      <li>
        Like any contract there needs to be proven consent by independent witnesses that the agreement is made freely with no coersion.  
      </li>
      <li>
        Marriage which involves any person who is not yet an <span term="adult"></span> requires the additional consent of their <span term="guardian"></span>.      
      </li>
      <li>The essential parts of a marriage agreement are that:
        <ol>
          <li>
            The woman agrees that she will have sex only with the man while she is married to him.
          </li>
          <li>
            The man agrees to provide for the needs of the woman and any children she has during the marriage.
          </li>
          <li>
            The man should give a guarantee payment to the woman to show that he will honour his commitment. 
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Additional obligtions may be requested and accepted by either side as part of the agreement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any person having sexual contact with someone without being able to prove consent to that contact is commiting a crime.  
      </li>
      <li>
        A marriage agreement can be ended or amended by a new agreement made by the man and the woman.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ending a marriage requires a three month period of separation before the marriage is formally ended. During this time if it is discovered that the woman is pregnant then the separation period must be until the end of the pregnancy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Either party can seek an end to the marriage without blaming the other party for any fault and announce their readiness to find a suitable settlement. The beginning of the separation period should start by the man announcing that the woman is released from her obligations to him.
      </li>
      <li>
        During the period of separation the man and woman must not have sex. If they do, then the separation period is considered to be over and the marriage is back in effect.  
      </li>
      <li>
        If the man initiates the ending of a marriage twice and twice cancels the separation period by having sex with his wife, then if there is a third announcement that the marriage is ended, he may not renew the marriage, until after the separation period is over, the marriage has ended and his former wife has married another man and her new husband has divorced her. 
      </li>
      <li>
        A marriage will be judged to be ended by desertion of either party for a period of any day more than 6 consecutive months. The deserting party will be held liable for all damages arising from their breach of contract. At a minimum for a woman who deserts her husband, she will be required to return the guarantee payment. For a man at a minimum he will be required to provide maintenance payments to the same standard of living that he has. These payments will be at least for the woman for 1 year and for all his children until they become adults. 
      </li>
      <li>
        If no agreement is reached between the separating couple as to how the children will be looked after, then the default rule is that both parents will share equal time with the children with the father paying for all costs according to his means.

    <h3>Inheritance Calculation</h3>
    <ol *ngIf="expand('inheritance-rules')">
      <li>
        Rights of inheritance are given in Islam to the children of the deceased as well as the people who were closest and most dependent on the deceased. In particular where specific shares are allocated, they go to primary heirs before other heirs are considered. Inheritance rights therefore are in order of priority:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Children and parents
          </li>
          <li>
            Wives and husbands
          </li>
          <li>
            Brothers and sisters
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Inheritance rights give more to some than others and those given more have a responsibility to provide for those given less.
      </li>
      <li>
        Marriages form the core partnerships and are based on the man providing an income and the woman in exchange fulfilling her maternal caring duties. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Specifically there are rights of financial dependency for essentials needs as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Parents must provide for the needs for their children who are unable to provide for themselves. This means until they are <span term="adult">s</span> or married.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adults must provide for the needs of their elderly parents who are unable to provide for themselves. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Husbands must provide for the needs for their wives.
          </li>
          <li>
            Brothers should provide for the needs for their sisters who have no closer relative
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        All debts must be paid before the inheritance rights are determined.      
      </li>
      <li>
        Anyone may make a will before they die to give specific shares from their estate to whoever they choose other than those who have inheritance rights on their estate. Such bequests must be paid before other inheritance rights are determined from the remainder and cannot exceed 1/3 of the estate. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Inheritance rights are as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Children and Parents<br/>
            <ol>
              <li>
                if the deceased left only one child and she is a daughter, then her share is 1/2.
              </li>
              <li>
                if the deceased left more than one child and all children are daughters, then their collective share is 2/3
              </li>
              <li>
                if the deceased left children and some of those children are sons, then the share left to each son should be twice the share left to each daughter.
              </li>
              <li>
                if the deceased left no children and left a mother and left no brothers then the mother's share is 1/3
              </li>
              <li>
                if the deceased left no children and left a mother and left any brothers then the mother's share is 1/6
              </li>
              <li>
                if the deceased left children then the father's share is 1/6 and the mother's share is 1/6
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Wives and Husbands<br/>
            Subject to the shares of the Children and Parents being paid, the following rules apply
            <ol>
              <li> 
                if the deceased was a woman and left a husband and she left no children then the husband's share is at most 1/2
              </li>
              <li> 
                if the deceased was a woman and left a husband and she left any children then the husband's share is at most 1/4
              </li>
              <li>
