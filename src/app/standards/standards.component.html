    <h3>Prayer Times and Direction</h3>
    <ol *ngIf="expand('prayer-times-rules')">
      <li>
        Standard prayer times are based on open source calculation algorithms for astronomical measures. In particular the following rules are applied:
        <ol>
          <li>
            There are adjustments for extreme latitudes to ensure that there are reasonable minimum and maximum times between the prayers. 
            <ol>
              <li>
              The time from the fajr prayer until the isha prayer does not exceed 20 hours.
              </li>
              <li>
              The time from sunrise to maghrib prayer time is at least 4 hours and is no more than 18 hours. 
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Fajr and Isha prayer times without adjustments are based on the sun being 18 degrees below the horizon corresponding to astronomical dawn and astronomical night respectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            Times are rounded up to the nearest minute. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Asr times are based on two thirds of the way between zuhr and maghrib prayer times
          </li>
          <li>
            A new moon is considered visible if it is more than 1 day old

    <h3>Zakat Payment</h3>
    <ol *ngIf="expand('zakat-rules')">
      <li>
         Zakat is a centrally collected charitable donation for wealth redistribution which all Muslims are religously obliged to pay if they are wealthy enough. The following rules should be used to calculate the amount of zakat owed:
        <ol>
          <li>
            A Muslim is judged to be wealthy enough if they have sufficient assets to pay for their needs and the needs of their dependents for the following year. 
          </li>
         
          <li>
            The standard goods and services which may be purchased and everyone needs are:
            <ol>
              <li>Water and Sewage</li>
              <li>Food</li>
              <li>Clothing</li>
              <li>Shelter</li>
              <li>Fuel</li>
              <li>Communication</li>
              <li>Transportation</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            The costs of needs are determined by an annually adjusted standard estimate of the cost of the needed goods and services per person per year. This is called the "Zakat Free Wealth Allowance".  
          </li>
          <li>
            For the 1437-1438 Hijri year (2016-2017) the Zakat Free Wealth Allowance is set to $15,000.00 USD
          </li>
          <li>
            All values should be calculated for the date of the 15th Ramadan 12pm GMT based on the standard prayer times calendar for London UK. This time is called the Zakat Date.
          </li>
          <li>
            The calculated Zakat Free Wealth Allowance in other currencies is based on conversion rates of the Zakat Date.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each individual calculates a Net Zakatable Wealth calculation. This is an estimate of the net value of all assets minus all debts that the individual and any dependents have on the Zakat date and then deducting the individual's Zakat Free Wealth Allowance. Debts should be estimated based on their immediate settlement value / cost.
          </li>
          <li>
            The amount of Zakat that should be paid is 1/40<sup>th</sup> of an individual's Net Zakatable Wealth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Zakat can be paid over the following year between the Zakat Date of one year and the Zakat Date of the next year. This allows ample time to sell any necessary assets and allows spreading the payment in easy installments. 
          </li>
          <li>
            A dependent has the right to have their needs met by the person they depend upon. 
          </li>
          <li>
            A individual can only have one person on whom they are declared dependent and who can add their Zakat Free Wealth Allowance, Assets and Debts to their own for a Zakat calculation.
